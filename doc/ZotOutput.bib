	abstract = {In this paper, we present Flask, a new programming language
for sensor networks that is focused on providing an
easy-to-use dataflow programming model. In Flask,
programmers build applications by composing chains of
operators into a dataflow graph that may reside on
individual nodes or span multiple nodes in the network. To
compose dataflow graphs across sensor nodes, Flask supports
a lean, general-purpose communication abstraction, called
Flows, that provides publish/subscribe semantics over
efficient routing trees. At the heart of Flask is a
programmatic wiring language, based on the functional
language {OCaml} [13]. Flask{\textquoteright}s wiring language allows
dataflow graphs to be synthesized programmatically. The
Flask wiring program is interpreted at compile time to
generate a sensor node program in {NesC}, which is then
compiled to a binary. Our design of Flask makes three main
contributions. First, Flask allows the programmer to specify
distributed dataflow applications in a high-level language
while retaining the efficiency of compiled binaries and full
access to {TinyOS} components. Second, Flask provides a
unified framework for distributing dataflow applications
across the network, allowing programmers to focus on
application logic rather than details of routing code.
Finally, Flask{\textquoteright}s programmatic wiring language enables rich
composition of dataflow operators, making it possible to
develop higher-level programming models or languages
directly in Flask. In this paper, we describe the design and
implementation of the Flask language, its runtime system,
the Flows communication interface, and a compiler that
produces {NesC} code. We evaluate Flask through two motivating
applications: a distributed detector of seismic activity
(e.g., for studying earthquakes), and an implementation of
the {TinyDB} query language built using Flask, showing that
using Flask considerably reduces code complexity and memory
size while achieving high runtime efficiency. 1},

Thirteen boys played a car racing video game on an Xbox platform while facial {EMG} data were collected. Through video review positive and negative events during play were identified. The zygomaticus muscle {EMG}, which controls smiling, was found to be significantly greater during positive events as compared to negative. The corrugator muscle {EMG}, which controls frowning, was found to be significantly greater during negative events. The results of this study demonstrate that positive valence can be measured during interactive experiences with physiologic measures. This study also found that the corrugator {EMG} can still measure negative valence during high intensity interactive play in spite of the confounding factor of mental effort. These methods appear useful for associating the player's emotion with game events, and could be applied to {HCI} in general.},

Blending no-nonsense empiricism with the humanistic desire to understand the whole person, the book is as relevant to students of personality psychology today as it was to its many readers 70 years ago. Assisted by such eminent colleagues as Erik Erikson and Robert White, Henry Murray set forth a full theory of human personality, illustrated a bevy of creative methods for personality assessment, and presented the results of a landmark study of fifty Harvard men. Explorations in Personality is one of the great classics in 20th century psychology.

Most community detection methods focus on partitioning the entire network into communities, with the expectation of many ties within communities and few ties between. However, many networks contain nodes that do not fit in with any of the communities, and forcing every node into a community can distort results. Here we propose a new framework that extracts one community at a time, allowing for arbitrary structure in the remainder of the network, which can include weakly connected nodes. The main idea is that the strength of a community should depend on ties between its members and ties to the outside world, but not on ties between nonmembers. The proposed extraction criterion has a natural probabilistic interpretation in a wide class of models and performs well on simulated and real networks. For the case of the block model, we establish asymptotic consistency of estimated node labels and propose a hypothesis test for determining the number of communities.},

	abstract = {Models of biochemical systems are typically formulated with kinetic data obtained from isolated enzymes studiedin vitro, and one has always to question whether or not all the relevant metabolites, processes and regulatory interactions have been identified and whether the parameter values obtainedin vitroreflect the actual intracellular environment. In this paper we extend and further test strategies for model assessment and refinement that take advantage of the power-law formalism, which provides the systematic structure underlying biochemical systems theory. Our purpose is three fold. First, we introduce an algorithm for systematically scanning a model for putative errors, which, if corrected, would reconcile its behaviour with the experimental system. Second, we further test the working hypothesis that systems in nature are selected to be robust and, hence, that the profile of parameter sensitivities can be used to identify poorly defined regions of a model. Third, we illustrate the use of these strategies within the context of a relatively large and realistic biochemical system--the metabolic pathways of the human red blood cell. Our results show that the reference model we have used is neither locally stable nor robust. The algorithm identifies a number of putative regulatory interactions that, when added to the model, are capable of stabilizing the nominal steady state. We include one of these, the feedback inhibition of hexokinase by fructose-6-phosphate, in a first refinement of the model because there is experimental support for it in the literature. Careful re-examination of the most sensitive section in this model, the pathways of nucleotide metabolism, reveals two mechanisms that were omitted from the reference model: membrane transport of adenosine and inosine, and regulation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase by adenosine diphosphate, 2,3 diphophoglycerate and 5- phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. It was also found that the concentration of inorganic phosphate had been inappropriately assumed to be a constant. Modifications to correct these deficiencies produced a second refinement of the model whose parameter sensitivities are reduced on average by 10-fold. Although these refinements are modest and there is substantial room for further improvement, this application identified several biochemically relevant features of the model that had been overlooked. It also points to nucleotide metabolism as the area most in need of further experimental study.},

	abstract = {Here we introduce a new design framework for synthetic biology that exploits the advantages of Bayesian model selection. We will argue that the difference between inference and design is that in the former we try to reconstruct the system that has given rise to the data that we observe, while in the latter, we seek to construct the system that produces the data that we would like to observe, i.e. the desired behavior. Our approach allows us to exploit methods from Bayesian statistics, including efficient exploration of models spaces and high-dimensional parameter spaces, and the ability to rank models with respect to their ability to generate certain types of data. Bayesian model selection furthermore automatically strikes a balance between complexity and (predictive or explanatory) performance of mathematical models. In order to deal with the complexities of molecular systems we employ an approximate Bayesian computation scheme which only requires us to simulate from different competing models in order to arrive at rational criteria for choosing between them. We illustrate the advantages resulting from combining the design and modeling (or in-silico prototyping) stages currently seen as separate in synthetic biology by reference to deterministic and stochastic model systems exhibiting adaptive and switch-like behavior, as well as bacterial two-component signaling systems.},

In this paper, we describe and compare both paradigms. Furthermore, we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity. To this end, we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of {MR} as well as on two parallel {DBMSs.} For each task, we measure each system's performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes. Our results reveal some interesting trade-offs. Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel {DBMSs} took much longer than the {MR} system, the observed performance of these {DBMSs} was strikingly better. We speculate about the causes of the dramatic performance difference and consider implementation concepts that future systems should take from both kinds of architectures.},

	abstract = {An important step in understanding a metabolic pathway is to identify its structure, in terms of the flow of material and information. In pursuing this goal, the available information for a given system is usually obtained from experiments in vitro and comes from different sources. Frequently, the final set of regulatory signals acting in the system in vivo is unclear, and some kind of test is needed on the intact system. Besides defining an appropriate experimental approach, identification of the regulatory pattern needs a theoretical framework in which the different experimental measurements can be evaluated and a final picture can be agreed on. Mathematical approaches based on sensitivity coefficients provide a useful tool for addressing this problem. Within this framework, the appropriate parameters are related to both the structure of the reaction network and the signals that regulate the target system. Thus the identification of the regulatory structure can be related to the estimation of the appropriate set of parameters. In pursuing this goal, we will show the limitations of using steady-state measurements and the usefulness of using dynamic data. We suggest a way to test the regulatory pattern in a given metabolic pathway by combining both kinds of data, and we show, by using a reference system, the potential of the method suggested.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Supporting the evolutionary modeling process of dynamic biochemical networks based on sampled in vivo data requires more than just simulation. In the course of the modeling process, the modeler is typically concerned not only with a single model but also with sequences, alternatives and structural variants of models. Powerful automatic methods are then required to assist the modeler in the organization and the evaluation of alternative models. Moreover, the structure and peculiarities of the data require dedicated tool support. Summary: To support all stages of an evolutionary modeling process, a new general formalism for the combinatorial specification of large model families is introduced. It allows for automatic navigation in the space of models and excludes biologically meaningless models on the basis of elementary flux mode analysis. An incremental usage of the measured data is supported by using splined data instead of state variables. With {MMT2}, a versatile tool has been developed as a computational engine intended to be built into a tool chain. Using automatic code generation, automatic differentiation for sensitivity analysis and grid computing technology, a high performance computing environment is achieved. {MMT2} supplies {XML} model specification and several software interfaces. The performance of {MMT2} is illustrated by several examples from ongoing research projects. Availability: http://www.simtec.mb.uni-siegen.de/ Contact: wiechert@simtec.mb.uni-siegen.de},

However, this theory has not yet been tested using biological {data.RESULTS:To} address this, we studied the relation between environmental variability and modularity in a natural and well-studied system, the metabolic networks of bacteria. We classified 117 bacterial species according to the degree of variability in their natural habitat. We find that metabolic networks of organisms in variable environments are significantly more modular than networks of organisms that evolved under more constant {conditions.CONCLUSION:This} study supports the view that variability in the natural habitat of an organism promotes modularity in its metabolic network and perhaps in other biological systems.},

	abstract = {The detection of synergisms - deviations from additive or linear behaviour - is often an important step in uncovering mechanisms of biochemical processes. Yet, a theoretical background for systemic analysis of synergisms in metabolic networks is lacking. Based on suitable mathematical models, such a theoretical approach should allow predicting synergisms and analysing what mechanistic features contribute to specific synergisms. This work presents a conceptual framework and formalism that fulfil these purposes. The synergism between perturbations of a pair of parameters is quantified as the difference between the response to the simultaneous perturbation of both parameters and the sum of the individual responses to the perturbations of each parameter. A generalisation measures deviations from multiplicative or power-law behaviour. These deviations were called log-synergisms, as in logarithmic coordinates they are quantified in the same way as the synergisms are in Cartesian coordinates. For small perturbations, synergisms and log-synergisms are approximately proportional to the second derivatives (in Cartesian and logarithmic coordinates, respectively) of the observable to the perturbed parameter(s). These derivatives, here called synergism or log-synergism coefficients, measure how steeply the responses diverge from linearity/additivity or power-law/multiplicativity. The formalism now presented allows evaluating (log-)synergism coefficients for systemic steady-state responses, and relates these coefficients to intrinsic kinetic properties of the underlying processes. A robust homeostasis of metabolite concentrations requires that these have moderate systemic log- and relative-synergism coefficients.},

A multilevel genetic programming approach is presented based on a new computational multilevel selection framework [19]. This approach considers biological group selection theory to encourage cooperation, and a new cooperation operator to build solutions hierarchically. It extends evolution from individuals to multiple group levels, leading to good performance on both individuals and groups. The applicability of this approach is evaluated on 7 multi-class classification problems with different features, such as non-linearity, skewed data distribution and large feature space. The results, when compared to other cooperative evolutionary algorithms in the literature, demonstrate that this approach improves solution accuracy and consistency, and simplifies solution complexity. In addition, the problem is decomposed as a result of evolution without human interference.},

Though the formalism presented there is adequate for studying simple models, the analysis of large-scale models benefits from the more effective formulation achieved in this work. The present formulation is based on simple tensor operations and takes advantage of the analogy between the formalisms for synergism and log-synergism analysis presented before. Well-known relationships of first-order sensitivity analysis and new relationships for (log-)synergism coefficients of various steady-state properties are cast in the new formal setting. The formalism is then extended to models that are subject to constraints between variables, fluxes and/or parameters. This treatment, which generalises Reder's concept of link matrices, is applied to networks that include moiety conservation cycles {[C.} Reder, Metabolic control theory: a structural approach, J. Theor. Biol. 135 (1988) 175]. It is also used to take advantage of flux conservation at steady-state to simplify synergism analysis.

	abstract = {Thanks to genetic and biochemical advances on the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila, theoretical models closely related to experimental observations can be considered for the regulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in this organism. Modeling is based on the autoregulatory negative feedback exerted by a complex between {PER} and {TIM} proteins on the expression of per and tim genes. The model predicts the occurrence of sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness. When incorporating light-induced {TIM} degradation, the model accounts for damping of oscillations in constant light, entrainment of the rhythm by light-dark cycles of varying period or photoperiod, and phase shifting by light pulses. The model further provides a molecular dynamical explanation for the permanent or transient suppression of circadian rhythmicity triggered in a variety of organisms by a critical pulse of light. Finally, the model shows that to produce a robust rhythm the various clock genes must be expressed at the appropriate levels since sustained oscillations only occur in a precise range of parameter values. {BioEssays} 22:84{\textendash}93, 2000. {\textcopyright}2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The challenge is how to integrate the large amount of data in order to gain novel biological insights. One way to leverage sequence data is to use genome-scale metabolic models. We have therefore designed and implemented a bioinformatics platform which supports the development of such metabolic {models.RESULTS:MEMOSys} {(MEtabolic} {MOdel} research and development System) is a versatile platform for the management, storage, and development of genome-scale metabolic models. It supports the development of new models by providing a built-in version control system which offers access to the complete developmental history. Moreover, the integrated web board, the authorization system, and the definition of user roles allow collaborations across departments and institutions. Research on existing models is facilitated by a search system, references to external databases, and a feature-rich comparison mechanism. {MEMOSys} provides customizable data exchange mechanisms using the {SBML} format to enable analysis in external tools. The web application is based on the Java {EE} framework and offers an intuitive user interface. It currently contains six annotated microbial metabolic {models.CONCLUSIONS:We} have developed a web-based system designed to provide researchers a novel application facilitating the management and development of metabolic models.

	lccn = {0000},
	abstract = {Kinetic models of biochemical systems can encompass a wide range of biochemical topics, some of which still poorly understood. This fact has the following implications. First, model development often requires engaging multiple experimental as well as computational experts in an iterative testing and refinement process. Second, models always rely on a number of assumptions that are subject to discussion and subsequent change. Third, thorough documentation of assumptions, underlying rationale, and discussions eventually leading to improvement are critical for effective development. Fourth, abstracted from this contextual information, models are of little use to third parties and prone to misinterpretation. However, although good tools for simulation and analysis of kinetic models {[Nat.} Biotechnol. 24:667-672, 2006], standards such as {SBML} {[Bioinformatics} 19:524-531, 2003] for porting models, and a centralized repository {(BioModels)} {[Nucleic} Acids Res. {34:D689-D691}, 2006] are available, good publicly available tools for assisting and thoroughly documenting collaborative model development remain lacking.
We are addressing this concern by developing {WikiModels} - a Web-based platform for distributed collaboration in iterative development of kinetic models. The current prototype permits editing, browsing and documenting models. Each entity (reactions, parameters, etc.) of a model can root threaded comments (discussion lists) thus enabling an open peer-review of each aspect. A unique immutable {URL} is associated to each element and comment, allowing external cross-reference. Models can be exported as {SBML} files. 
The platform follows the principles of a {RESTful} architecture and heavily borrows from Semantic Web ideas and technologies. 
Ongoing developments include a Wiki-like history for models, as well as a {Role-Based} Access Control system. Future developments will include a simulation engine and tools for model analysis and assessment.},

	abstract = {Many seemingly different problems in artificial intelligence, symbolic processing, and machine learning can be viewed as requiring discovery of a computer program that produces some desired output for particular inputs. When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a most fit individual computer program. The new "genetic programming" paradigm described herein provides a way to search for this most fit individual computer program. In this new "genetic programming" paradigm, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. In this paper, the process of formulating and solving problems using this new paradigm is illustrated using examples from various areas. Examples come from the areas of machine learning of a function; planning; sequence induction; function function identification (including symbolic regression, empirical discovery, "data to function" symbolic integration, "data to function" symbolic differentiation); solving equations, including differential equations, integral equations, and functional equations); concept formation; automatic programming; pattern recognition, time-optimal control; playing differential pursuer-evader games; neural network design; and finding a game-playing strategyfor a discrete game in extensive form.},

	abstract = {Microbial secretions manipulate the environment and communicate information to neighbours. The secretions of an individual microbe typically act externally and benefit all members of the local group. Secreting imposes a cost in terms of growth, so that cheaters that do not secrete gain by sharing the benefits without paying the costs. Cheaters have been observed in several experimental and natural settings. Given that cheaters grow faster than secretors when in direct competition, what maintains the widely observed patterns of secretion? Recent theory has emphasized the genetic structure of populations, in which secretors tend to associate spatially with other secretors, reducing direct competition and allowing highly secreting groups to share mutual benefits. Such kin selection can be a powerful force favouring cooperative traits. Here, I argue that, although kin selection is a factor, the combination of mutation and demographic processes dominate in determining the relative fitness of secretors versus cheaters when measured over the full cycle of microbial life history. Key demographic factors include the local density of microbes at which secretion significantly alters the environment, the extent to which secretion enhances microbial growth and maximum local density, and the ways in which secretion alters colony survival and dispersal.},

	abstract = {One of the most important criteria for performance quality in both art and design seems to be the creativity of the product. Being original and innovative is by definition a feature of both areas. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether human judgment of creativity is a reliable and valid method in design evaluation and selection. In a first experiment, the judgments of experts, nonexperts, and people with an intermediate level of expertise were compared. They rated 44 first-year designs on creativity, prototypical value, attractiveness, interest, technical quality, expressiveness, and integrating capacity. Pearson product-moment correlations for creativity were relatively low, ranging from .23 to .29. There was little difference between experts and nonexperts. The results confirmed the research in artwork assessment. In Experiment 2 the results were replicated with senior design students as judges, a group with an intermediate level of expertise. Ratings were given for 3 different designs. Correlations were much higher, ranging from .48 to .57. This could be a consequence of the homogeneity of the group of judges. The prototypicality of a design, the distance between the design and the observers' internal representation, appeared to discriminate between creativity and other aesthetic criteria. A pair-comparisons analysis also contributed to the definition of creativity in both general and domain-specific terms.},

Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

The conclusion is that the brain heavily relies on the environment to function as an external memory, a trigger for actions, and a source of [`]affordances', disturbances and feedback. We show how these principles are practically implemented in {GTD}, with its focus on organizing tasks into [`]actionable' external memories, and on opportunistic, situation-dependent execution.

Peptide arrays are emerging as an important means of characterizing kinome activity. Currently, the computational tools used to perform high-throughput kinome analyses are not specifically tailored to the nature of the data, which hinders extraction of biological information and overall progress in the field. We have developed a method for kinome analysis, which is implemented as a software pipeline in the R environment. Components and parameters were chosen to address the technical and biological characteristics of kinome microarrays. We performed comparative analysis of kinome data sets that corresponded to stimulation of immune cells with ligands of well-defined signaling pathways: bovine monocytes treated with interferon-{gamma} {(IFN-{gamma})}, {CpG-containing} nucleotides, or lipopolysaccharide {(LPS).} The data sets for each of the treatments were analyzed with our methodology as well as with three other commonly used approaches. The methods were evaluated on the basis of statistical confidence of calculated values with respect to technical and biological variability, and the statistical confidence {(P} values) by which the known signaling pathways could be independently identified by the pathway analysis of {InnateDB} (a Web-based resource for innate immunity interactions and pathways). By considering the particular attributes of kinome data, we found that our approach identified more of the peptides involved in the pathways than did the other compared methods and that it did so at a much higher degree of statistical confidence.},

This approach was used successfully in a number of biochemical and other biological applications throughout the 1970s and 1980s. A related approach, Metabolic Control Theory {(MCT)}, was proposed in the mid 1970s. Its developments generally have followed without reference the analogous developments in {BST}, and its proponents have treated the two approaches as if they were unrelated. Detailed comparison of the fundamental structures of {BST} and {MCT} shows that, although there are some superficial differences, both in fact are based upon the same underlying formalism. Molecular descriptions in {MCT} comprise a special case of those in {BST.} Systemic descriptions differ with respect to the level of aggregation assumed. The aggregation at the level of net increase or net decrease of each system constituent found in {BST} is shown to produce the more revealing and useful theory, and results presented elsewhere [41] suggest that this level of aggregation also provides a more accurate description of the system. At this fundamental level, {MCT} represents a special case of {BST}, for the content and range of validity of {BST} are more inclusive than those of {MCT.}},

	title = {Toolbox model of evolution of metabolic pathways on networks of arbitrary topology},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4478},
	abstract = {In prokaryotic genomes the number of transcriptional regulators is known to quadratically scale with the total number of protein-coding genes. Toolbox model was recently proposed to explain this scaling for metabolic enzymes and their regulators. According to its rules the metabolic network of an organism evolves by horizontal transfer of pathways from other species. These pathways are part of a larger "universal" network formed by the union of all species-specific networks. It remained to be understood, however, how the topological properties of this universal network influence the scaling law of functional content of genomes. In this study we answer this question by first analyzing the scaling properties of the toolbox model on arbitrary tree-like universal networks. We mathematically prove that the critical branching topology, in which the average number of upstream neighbors of a node is equal to one, is both necessary and sufficient for the quadratic scaling. Conversely, the toolbox model on trees with exponentially expanding, supercritical topology is characterized by the linear scaling with logarithmic corrections. We further generalize our model to include reactions with multiple substrates/products as well as branched or cyclic metabolic pathways. Unlike the original model the new version employs evolutionary optimized pathways with the smallest number of reactions necessary to achieve their metabolic tasks. Numerical simulations of this most realistic model on the universal network from the {KEGG} database again produced approximately quadratic scaling. Our results demonstrate why, in spite of their "small-world" topology, real-life metabolic networks are characterized by a broad distribution of pathway lengths and sizes of metabolic regulons in regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {The need for a well-structured theory of intact biochemical systems becomes increasingly evident as one attempts to integrate the vast knowledge of individual molecular constituents, which has been expanding for several decades. In recent years, several apparently different approaches to the development of such a theory have been proposed. Unfortunately, the resulting theories have not been distinguished from each other, and this has led to considerable confusion with numerous duplications and rediscoveries. Detailed comparisons and critical tests of alternative theories are badly needed to reverse these unfortunate developments. In this paper we (1) characterize a specific system involving enzyme-enzyme interactions for reference in comparing alternative theories, and (2) analyze the reference system by applying the explicit S-system variant within biochemical systems theory {(BST)}, which represents a fundamental framework based upon the power-law formalism and includes several variants. The results provide the first complete and rigorous numerical analysis within the power-law formalism of a specific biochemical system and further evidence for the accuracy of the explicit S-system variant within {BST.} This theory is shown to represent enzyme-enzyme interactions in a systematically structured fashion that facilitates analysis of complex biochemical systems in which these interactions play a prominent role. This representation also captures the essential character of the underlying nonlinear processes over a wide range of variation (on average 20-fold) in the independent variables of the system. In the companion paper in this issue the same reference system is analyzed by other variants within {BST} as well as by two additional theories within the same power-law formalism{\textemdash}flux-oriented and metabolic control theories. The results show how all these theories are related to one another.},

We show that in the artificial model such preference originates from a stronger preservation of protein than regulatory sites by duplication and divergence.

The Synthetic Biology Software Suite {(SynBioSS)} is used for the generation, storing, retrieval and quantitative simulation of synthetic biological networks. {SynBioSS} consists of three distinct components: the Desktop Simulator, the Wiki, and the Designer. {SynBioSS} Designer takes as input molecular parts involved in gene expression and regulation (e.g. promoters, transcription factors, ribosome binding sites, etc.), and automatically generates complete networks of reactions that represent transcription, translation, regulation, induction and degradation of those parts. Effectively, Designer uses {DNA} sequences as input and generates networks of biomolecular reactions as output. In this paper we describe how Designer uses universal principles of molecular biology to generate models of any arbitrary synthetic biological system. These models are useful as they explain biological phenotypic complexity in mechanistic terms. In turn, such mechanistic explanations can assist in designing synthetic biological systems. We also discuss, giving practical guidance to users, how Designer interfaces with the Registry of Standard Biological Parts, the de facto compendium of parts used in synthetic biology applications.},

Our insight into the documents and capabilities available are based on keyword searches, abetted by clever use of document connectivity and usage patterns. The sheer mass of this data is unmanageable without powerful tool support. In order to map this terrain more precisely, computational agents require machine-readable descriptions of the content and capabilities of Web accessible resources. These descriptions must be in addition to the human-readable versions of that information.

The {OWL} Web Ontology Language is intended to provide a language that can be used to describe the classes and relations between them that are inherent in Web documents and applications.

This document demonstrates the use of the {OWL} language to

   1. formalize a domain by defining classes and properties of those classes,
   2. define individuals and assert properties about them, and
   3. reason about these classes and individuals to the degree permitted by the formal semantics of the {OWL} language.

The sections are organized to present an incremental definition of a set of classes, properties and individuals, beginning with the fundamentals and proceeding to more complex language components.},

Because there are exponentially many combinations of future choices and actions, brute-force approaches that consider all possible combinations work only for trivially small problems. Here, we describe how humans use a simple Pavlovian strategy to cut an expanding decision tree down to a computationally manageable size. We find that humans use this strategy even when it is disadvantageous, and that the tendency to use it is related to mild depressive symptoms. The findings, we suggest, can be interpreted within a theoretical framework which relates Pavlovian behavioural inhibition to serotonin and mood disorders.},

Goals are statements of intent organized in {AND/OR} refinement structures; they range from high-level, strategic concerns to low-level, technical requirements on the software-to-be and assumptions on its environment. The operationalization of system goals into specifications of software services is a core aspect of the requirements elaboration process for which little systematic and constructive support is available. In particular, most formal methods assume such operational specifications to be given and focus on their a posteriori {analysis.The} paper considers a formal, constructive approach in which operational software specifications are built incrementally from higher-level goal formulations in a way that guarantees their correctness by construction. The operationalization process is based on formal derivation rules that map goal specifications to specifications of software operations; more specifically, these rules map real-time temporal logic specifications to sets of pre-, post- and trigger conditions. The rules define operationalization patterns that may be used for guiding and documenting the operationalization process while hiding all formal reasoning details; the patterns are formally proved correct once and for all. The catalog of operationalization patterns is structured according to a rich taxonomy of goal specification {patterns.Our} constructive approach to requirements elaboration requires a multiparadigm specification language that supports incremental reasoning about partial models. The paper also provides a formal semantics for goal operationalization and discusses several semantic features of our language that allow for such incremental reasoning.},

It catalyzes the reversible transfer of high-energy phosphate from {ATP} to creatine, facilitating storage of energy in the form of phosphocreatine. In muscle cells, this extra energy buffer plays a pivotal role in maintaining {ATP} homeostasis. Another proposed function of {CK} is the transport of energy from {ATP} producing to {ATP} consuming sites via a shuttle mechanism involving a mitochondrial and a myofibrillar isoform of {CK.} The extent to which this {\textquoteleft}phosphocreatine shuttle{\textquoteright} mechanism is used in muscle and other tissues is hotly debated. We use a computational model of the {CK} system which can predict energy transport and buffering of high demand peaks to estimate the relative importance of both roles in heart muscle. We validate the model with multiscale data on the level of enzyme kinetic constants and with dynamic oxygen consumption measurements in rabbit hearts. Since model predictions can be strongly affected by changes in parameter values, we employ {\textquoteleft}sloppy{\textquoteright} ensemble modeling which allows to set confidence regions for predictions. Our results indicate that the main function of {CK} in heart muscle lies more in temporal energy buffering of high peaks in {ATP} consumption during cardiac contraction than in energy transportation.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in the investigation and development of the next generation web - the Semantic Web. While most of the current forms of web content are designed to be presented to humans, but are barely understandable by computers, the content of the Semantic Web is structured in a semantic way so that it is meaningful to computers as well as to humans. In this paper, we report a survey of recent research on the Semantic Web. In particular, we present the opportunities that this revolution will bring to us: web-services, agent-based distributed computing, semantics-based web search engines, and semantics-based digital libraries. We also discuss the technical and cultural challenges of realizing the Semantic Web: the development of ontologies, formal semantics of Semantic Web languages, and trust and proof models. We hope that this will shed some light on the direction of future work on this field.},

	abstract = {Most sensor network research and software design has been guided by an architectural principle that permits multi-node data fusion on small-form-factor, resource-poor nodes, or motes. We argue that this principle leads to fragile and unmanageable systems and explore an alternative. The Tenet architecture is motivated by the observation that future large-scale sensor network deployments will be tiered, consisting of motes in the lower tier and masters, relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Masters provide increased network capacity. Tenet constrains multi-node fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process locally-generated sensor data. This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. Applications running on masters task motes by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses. We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native implementation while being considerably more compact.},

The goal of {MathML} is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as {HTML} has enabled this functionality for text.

This specification of the markup language {MathML} is intended primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will communicate using {MathML} as a protocol for input or output. It is not a User's Guide but rather a reference document.

This document begins with background information on mathematical notation, the problems it poses, and the philosophy underlying the solutions {MathML} 2.0 proposes. {MathML} can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty of the {MathML} tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and fifty provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the {MathML} content and presentation elements interact, and how {MathML} renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of {MathML} characters and their relation to fonts.

While {MathML} is human-readable, it is anticipated that, in all but the simplest cases, authors will use equation editors, conversion programs, and other specialized software tools to generate {MathML.} Several versions of such {MathML} tools already exist, and a number of others, both freely available software and commercial products, are under development.},

This class of networks share topological features with natural transcriptional regulatory networks. Specifically, these networks display scale-free and small-world topology and possess subgraph distributions similar to those of natural networks. Thus, the topologies inherent in natural networks may be in part due to their method of creation rather than being exclusively shaped by subsequent evolution under selection.
The evolvability of the dynamics of these networks is also examined by evolving networks in simulation to obtain three simple types of output dynamics. The networks obtained from this process show a wide variety of topologies and numbers of genes indicating that it is relatively easy to evolve these classes of dynamics in this model.},

We describe the software engineering principles guiding {REST} and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

	abstract = {The {NADPH} redox cycle plays a key role in antioxidant protection of human erythrocytes. It consists of two enzymes: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase {(G6PD)} and glutathione reductase. Over 160 {G6PD} variants have been characterized and associated with several distinct clinical manifestations. However, the mechanistic link between the genotype and the phenotype remains poorly understood.

We address this issue through a novel framework (design space) that integrates information at the genetic, biochemical and clinical levels. Our analysis predicts three qualitatively-distinct phenotypic regions that can be ranked according to fitness. When {G6PD} variants are analyzed in design space, a correlation is revealed between the phenotypic region and the clinical manifestation: the best region with normal physiology, the second best region with a pathology, and the worst region with a potential lethality. We also show that Plasmodium falciparum, by induction of its own {G6PD} gene in {G6PD-deficient} erythrocytes, moves the operation of the cycle to a region of the design space that yields robust performance.

In conclusion, the design space for the {NADPH} redox cycle, which includes relationships among genotype, phenotype and environment, illuminates the function, design and fitness of the cycle, and its phenotypic regions correlate with the organism's clinical status.},

Standards for representation of information about pathways are necessary for integration and analysis of data from various sources. Recently, a number of representation formats for pathway data, {SBML}, {PSI} {MI} and {BioPAX}, have been proposed. Results: In this paper we compare these formats and evaluate them with respect to their underlying models, information content and possibilities for easy creation of tools. The evaluation shows that the main structure of the formats is similar. However, {SBML} is tuned towards simulation models of molecular pathways while {PSI} {MI} is more suitable for representing details about particular interactions and experiments. {BioPAX} is the most general and expressive of the formats. These differences are apparent in allowed information and the structure for representation of interactions. We discuss the impact of these differences both with respect to information content in existing databases and computational properties for import and analysis of data. Contact: lestr@ida.liu.se},

	url = {http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm},
	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.

Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.

This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer {(REST)} architectural style and describe how {REST} has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web.

{REST} emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding {REST} and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying {REST} to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

	abstract = {Summary The local stability of unbranched biosynthetic pathways is examined by mathematical analysis and computer simulation using a novel nonlinear formalism that appears to accurately describe biochemical systems. Four factors affecting the stability are examined: strength of feedback inhibition, equalization of the values among the corresponding kinetic parameters for the reactions of the pathway, pathway length, and alternative patterns of feedback interaction. The strength of inhibition and the pattern of feedback interactions are important determinants of steady-state behavior. The simple pattern of end-product inhibition in unbranched pathways may have evolved because it optimizes the steady-state behavior and is temporally most responsive to change. Stability in these simple systems is achieved by shortening pathway length either physically or, in the case of necessarily long pathways, kinetically by a wide divergence in the values of the corresponding kinetic parameters for the reactions of the pathway. These conclusions are discussed in the light of available experimental evidence.},

	abstract = {Crustaceans are second intermediate hosts to several microphallid species {(Trematoda).} Some of these parasites are potentially pathogenic or manipulative. A laboratory experiment was performed to assess the impact of microphallids on the survival, growth and fecundity of Cyathura carinata, a protogynous hermaphroditic isopod, widespread within European estuaries. For nearly 12 weeks, experimental populations of infected and non-infected isopods were kept at 25 {{\textdegree}C.} C. carinata carrying microphallid cysts showed higher mortality rates than non-infected specimens and were not able to produce embryos. The reduced fecundity of infected isopods could be caused by parasite-induced castration and/or by mating failure due to behavioural modifications in one of the sexes. It might also be associated with lower growth rates and lower moulting frequencies, since infected C. carinata were significantly smaller than the non-infected after 9 weeks. This may imply a setback for the isopods to achieve sexual maturity (which may also affect the population sex ratio) and for females to lay their eggs in the marsupia. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, microphallids may have severe consequences for their host populations, through negative effects on survival, growth and fecundity. For species with direct development, such as C. carinata, parasite-induced reproduction failure may contribute to temporal fluctuations of abundance. Based on the present results, it is recommended to include parasites as an important factor influencing host populations from shallow-water ecosystems.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that aging is associated with cognitive declines in many domains. Yet it is a common lay belief that some aspects of thinking improve into old age. Specifically, older people are believed to show better competencies for reasoning about social dilemmas and conflicts. Moreover, the idea of aging-related gains in wisdom is consistent with views of the aging mind in developmental psychology. However, to date research has provided little evidence corroborating this assumption. We addressed this question in two studies, using a representative community sample. We asked participants to read stories about intergroup conflicts and interpersonal conflicts and predict how these conflicts would unfold. We show that relative to young and middle-aged people, older people make more use of higher-order reasoning schemes that emphasize the need for multiple perspectives, allow for compromise, and recognize the limits of knowledge. Our coding scheme was validated by a group of professional counselors and wisdom researchers. Social reasoning improves with age despite a decline in fluid intelligence. The results suggest that it might be advisable to assign older individuals to key social roles involving legal decisions, counseling, and intergroup negotiations. Furthermore, given the abundance of research on negative effects of aging, this study may help to encourage clinicians to emphasize the inherent strengths associated with aging.},

	abstract = {Web-based biomedical communities are becoming an increasingly popular vehicle for sharing information amongst researchers and are fast gaining an online presence. However, information organization and exchange in such communities is usually unstructured, rendering interoperability between communities difficult. Furthermore, specialized software to create such communities at low cost--targeted at the specific common information requirements of biomedical researchers--has been largely lacking. At the same time, a growing number of biological knowledge bases and biomedical resources are being structured for the Semantic Web. Several groups are creating reference ontologies for the biomedical domain, actively publishing controlled vocabularies and making data available in Resource Description Framework {(RDF)} language. We have developed the Science Collaboration Framework {(SCF)} as a reusable platform for advanced structured online collaboration in biomedical research that leverages these ontologies and {RDF} resources. {SCF} supports structured Web 2.0' style community discourse amongst researchers, makes heterogeneous data resources available to the collaborating scientist, captures the semantics of the relationship among the resources and structures discourse around the resources. The first instance of the {SCF} framework is being used to create an open-access online community for stem cell {research--StemBook} (http://www.stembook.org). We believe that such a framework is required to achieve optimal productivity and leveraging of resources in interdisciplinary scientific research. We expect it to be particularly beneficial in highly interdisciplinary areas, such as neurodegenerative disease and neurorepair research, as well as having broad utility across the natural sciences. 10.1093/bib/bbn052},

This means that if a user has a particular administrative privilege, then she is also implicitly authorized for weaker administrative privileges. We prove the non-trivial result that it is possible to decide whether one administrative privilege is weaker than another and show how this result can be used to decide administrative requests in an {RBAC} security monitor.},

	abstract = {Human erythrocytes are among the simplest of cells. Many of their enzymes have been characterized kinetically using steady-state methods in vitro, and several investigators have assembled this kinetic information into mathematical models of the integrated system. However, despite its relative simplicity, the integrated behavior of erythrocyte metabolism is still complex and not well understood. Errors will inevitably be encountered in any such model because of this complexity; thus, the construction of an integrative model must be considered an iterative process of assessment and refinement. In a previous study, we selected a recent model of erythrocyte metabolism as our starting point and took it through three stages of model assessment and refinement using systematic strategies provided by biochemical systems theory. At each stage deficiencies were diagnosed, putative remedies were identified, and modifications consistent with existing experimental evidence were incorporated into the working model. In this paper we address two issues: the propagation of biochemical signals within the metabolic network, and the accuracy of kinetic representation. The analysis of signal propagation reveals the importance of glutathione peroxidase, transaldolase, and the concentration of total glutathione in determining systemic behavior. It also reveals a highly amplified diversion of flux between the pathways of pentose phosphate and nucleotide metabolism. In determining the range of accurate representation based on alternative kinetic formalisms we discovered large discrepancies. These were identified with the behavior of the model represented within the {Michaelis-Menten} formalism. This model fails to exhibit a nominal steady state when the activity of glutathione peroxidase is decreased by as little as 9\%. Our current understanding, as embodied in this working model, is in need of further refinement, and the results presented in this paper suggest areas of the model where such effort might profitably be concentrated.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades, several theories, all ultimately based upon the same power-law formalism, have been proposed to relate the behavior of intact biochemical system to the properties of their underlying determinants. Confusion concerning the relatedness of these alternatives has become acute because the implications of these theories have never been compared. In the preceding paper we characterized a specific system involving enzyme- enzyme interactions for reference in comparing alternative theories. We also analyzed the reference system by using an explicit variant that involves the S-system representation within biochemical systems theory {(BST).} We now analyze the same reference system according to two other variants within {BST.} First, we carry out the analysis by using an explicit variant that involves the generalized mass action representation, which includes the flux-oriented theory of Crabtee and Newsholme as a special case. Second, we carry out the analysis by using an implicit variant that involves the generalized mass action representation, which includes the metabolic control theory of Kacser and his colleagues as a special case. The explicit variants are found to provide a more complete characterization of the reference system that the implicit variants. Within each of these variant classes, the S-system representation is shown to be more mathematically tractable and accurate than the generalized mass action representation. The results allow one to make clear distinctions among the variant theories.},

	abstract = {We extend the study of a computational model recently proposed for the mammalian circadian clock {(Proc.} Natl Acad. Sci. {USA} 100 (2003) 7051). The model, based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1, and Clock genes, can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian oscillations, we compare the effect of the various parameters and show that both the occurrence and the period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related to synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 {mRNA} and {BMAL1} protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between {PER} and {CRY} and the activators {CLOCK} and {BMAL1} that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. Thus, sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological conditions, and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light{\textendash}dark {(LD)} cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in {LD} critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of {CRY} protein. Small changes in the parameters governing {CRY} levels can shift the peak in Per {mRNA} from the L to the D phase, or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep{\textendash}wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian clock, such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24\&\#xa0;h sleep{\textendash}wake syndrome.},

The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Compared} to more general networks, biochemical networks have some special features: while generally sparse, there are a small number of highly connected metabolite nodes; and metabolite nodes can also be divided into two classes: internal nodes with associated mass balance constraints and external ones without. Based on these features, reclassifying selected internal nodes (separators) to external ones can be used to divide a large complex metabolic network into simpler subnetworks. Selection of separators based on node connectivity is commonly used but affords little detailed control and tends to produce excessive fragmentation. The method proposed here {(Netsplitter)} allows the user to control separator selection. It combines local connection degree partitioning with global connectivity derived from random walks on the network, to produce a more even distribution of subnetwork sizes. Partitioning is performed progressively and the interactive visual matrix presentation used allows the user considerable control over the process, while incorporating special strategies to maintain the network integrity and minimise the information loss due to {partitioning.RESULTS:Partitioning} of a genome scale network of 1348 metabolites and 1468 reactions for Arabidopsis thaliana encapsulates 66\% of the network into 10 medium sized subnets. Applied to the flavonoid subnetwork extracted in this way, it is shown that Netsplitter separates this naturally into four subnets with recognisable functionality, namely synthesis of lignin precursors, flavonoids, coumarin and benzenoids. A quantitative quality measure called efficacy is constructed and shows that the new method gives improved partitioning for several metabolic networks, including bacterial, plant and mammal {species.CONCLUSIONS:For} the examples studied the Netsplitter method is a considerable improvement on the performance of connection degree partitioning, giving a better balance of subnet sizes with the removal of fewer mass balance constraints. In addition, the user can interactively control which metabolite nodes are selected for cutting and when to stop further partitioning as the desired granularity has been reached. Finally, the blocking transformation at the heart of the procedure provides a powerful visual display of network structure that may be useful for its exploration independent of whether partitioning is required.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms often have to solve optimization problems in the presence of a wide range of uncertainties. Generally, uncertainties in evolutionary computation can be divided into the following four categories. First, the fitness function is noisy. Second, the design variables and/or the environmental parameters may change after optimization, and the quality of the obtained optimal solution should be robust against environmental changes or deviations from the optimal point. Third, the fitness function is approximated, which means that the fitness function suffers from approximation errors. Fourth, the optimum of the problem to be solved changes over time and, thus, the optimizer should be able to track the optimum continuously. In all these cases, additional measures must be taken so that evolutionary algorithms are still able to work satisfactorily. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the related work within a unified framework, which has been scattered in a variety of research areas. Existing approaches to addressing different uncertainties are presented and discussed, and the relationship between the different categories of uncertainties are investigated.

This new theory of creative problem solving constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena (in part by reinterpreting/integrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight). The explicit{\textendash}implicit interaction theory relies mainly on 5 basic principles, namely, (a) the coexistence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge, (b) the simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks, (c) the redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge, (d) the integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing, and (e) the iterative (and possibly bidirectional) processing. A computational implementation of the theory is developed based on the {CLARION} cognitive architecture and applied to the simulation of relevant human data.

With the introduction of {SBML} level 2 version 3, specific model entities, such as species or reactions, can now be annotated using ontological terms. These annotations, which are encoded using the resource description framework {(RDF)}, provide the facility to specify definite terms to individual components, allowing software to unambiguously identify such components and thus link the models to existing data resources.
{libSBML} is an application programming interface library for the manipulation of {SBML} files. While {libSBML} provides the facilities for reading and writing such annotations from and to models, it is beyond the scope of {libSBML} to provide interpretation of these terms. The {libAnnotationSBML} library introduced here acts as a layer on top of {libSBML} linking {SBML} annotations to the web services that describe these ontological terms. Two applications that use this library are described: {SbmlSynonymExtractor} finds name synonyms of {SBML} model entities and {SbmlReactionBalancer} checks {SBML} files to determine whether specifed reactions are elementally balanced.

The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems.},

	abstract = {Most proteins fold to a well-defined, three-dimensional structure, which can be delineated into the protein surface and its buried core. When comparing amino acid sequences of the same protein from different organisms, we would expect to find certain residue positions conserved due to the importance of that position in either maintaining the protein's function or its three-dimensional structure. In this study, we looked at residues in the buried core domains of histone proteins H3 and H4, which have no known function other than maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the protein. We find that perturbing protein stability (which is a measure of maintenance of the protein's structure) by mutating these residues compromises survival fitness in yeast. However, the stability conferred by buried amino acids of H3 alone cannot account for their evolutionary conservation, which is in striking contrast to other proteins where stability has been shown to be the driving force for sequence conservation. This conservation of H3 thus points to either new additional functions of H3 that have not been uncovered or a unique conservation mechanism that goes beyond survival pressure. These data therefore reveal a highly conserved domain that is distinct in its evolutionary conservation.},

	abstract = {The creation of quantitative, simulatable, Systems Biology Markup Language {(SBML)} models that accurately simulate the system under study is a time-intensive manual process that requires careful checking. Currently, the rules and constraints of model creation, curation, and annotation are distributed over at least three separate documents: the {SBML} schema document {(XSD)}, the Systems Biology Ontology {(SBO)}, and the {?Structures} and Facilities for Model Definition? document. The latter document contains the richest set of constraints on models, and yet it is not amenable to computational processing. We have developed a Web Ontology Language {(OWL)} knowledge base that integrates these three structure documents, and that contains a representative sample of the information contained within them. This Model Format {OWL} {(MFO)} performs both structural and constraint integration and can be reasoned over and validated. {SBML} Models are represented as individuals of {OWL} classes, resulting in a single computationally amenable resource for model checking. Knowledge that was only accessible to humans is now explicitly and directly available for computational approaches. The integration of all structural knowledge for {SBML} models into a single resource creates a new style of model development and checking.},
