\section{Introduction}

The main purpose of this work is to buld a chemical reaction simulator in Prolog.  The main raesons to do it within this language and platform are twofold: [i] since the prolog interperter is used, this gives ChemlogSim the hability ,  and (ii) aasdd

\section{Prolog}
The Prolog language includes three different kinds of expressions: facts, rules and queries.

Prolog is much better understood as a language with two unusual features--unification and backtracking. (It also makes heavy use of recursion, which is more common than unification and backtracking but difficult to grasp if you haven't encountered it before.)

Prolog's interface, however (along with much of the Prolog literature), deliberately leads the developer into a conceptual model of logic--and away from Prolog's true inner workings. The syntax of the language is derived from Horn clauses (an area of logic), and early teaching examples emphasize the Prolog-logic connection.\cite{merritt1992}.

[...]

Prolog, billed as "logic programming", is not really. You may be disappointed if that's what you expected to find. On the other hand, having backtracking, unification, and recursion inside one computer language leads to something very powerful and special.\cite{merritt1992}

\begin{equation}
y'(t) = f(t,y(t)), \qquad \qquad y(t_0)=y_0.
